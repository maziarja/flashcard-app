#### Study Mode

- Study flashcards one at a time in Study Mode
- Click on a flashcard to reveal the answer
- Mark a flashcard as known by clicking "I Know This" to track mastery progress

- See which card they're currently viewing (e.g., "Card 1 of 40")
- Track mastery progress for each card on a scale of 0 to 5
- Reset progress on a flashcard to start learning it again

#### Filtering & Organization
